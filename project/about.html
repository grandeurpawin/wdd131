                <h2>Where Warmth Began in the Year 2000</h2>
                <p>Tara: Kape sa Katipunan was founded in 2000, in our mountainside community of Arakan, known for its cold, fog-filled
                mornings. The air was so crisp that every conversation came with visible breath, drifting like soft smoke between
                friends. Inspired by those chilly mornings, we dreamed of a place where people could gather, talk freely, and share
                stories without shivering — a space where warmth could be felt not just in the atmosphere, but in every cup served. From
                that simple desire, our café was born: a welcoming retreat where handcrafted coffee brings comfort, connection, and
                warmth to every foggy morning.
